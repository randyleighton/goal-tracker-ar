#Goal Tracker

This is an active record Ruby project by Randy Leighton

This allows you to add players, games and create goals scored by players in a join table.

This utilizes active record instead of SQL like the previous version of the Goal Tracker.

Project focuses on meeting assessment criteria for Active Record mastery including:

associations, validations, scopes and callbacks
